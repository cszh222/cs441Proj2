Milestone 1 complete.
C++ style variables
C++ style single and multiple lines
Symbol table using symbol_table.cc
Can declared int and double
do-while and repeat-until loops works

Milestone 2 complete.
During milestone 2, the build file was removed. In order to complile, make is required.
Flex and Bison files are now compiled into c++ files instead of c.
This was done to use the PStack class. c does not support classes.
PStack code generation for the following:
	expressions
	variables
	if statements
	while loop
	do-while loo
	repeat-until loop
The PStack code generated has only been tested manually.
Automated tests have not been run.

Milestone 3 complete.
General code cleanup: 
	Removed all interpretor code
	ex() now returns an integer for variables, constants, and expressions
	ex() returns 0 all others
Added block lexical analysis to the lexical analyzer and parser.
Variables can be redeclared inside a block.
Currently does not support static scoping. 
Changing a variable value will also change its value outside the block.
We already have a good idea on how to fix this.

Can be compiled with the makefile by typing make.
Can be cleaned with make clean.
